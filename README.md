SQLProject
==========
Welcome to my SQL project for my IS380: Database Management class

This project took me about a month to complete. It provided me to flex what skills I know in writing pure SQL.

//Overview

It is based upon a office supply store which supplies things such as sissors, pens, etc. for customers to order from a
multitude of warehouses.
When a customer orders an item or many items, it is then logged and order and shipping confirmation is given.
In addition to this, the user can look up how long on average their shipment may take to ship and can see product levels
for each warehouse.

I used Notepad++ and SQLPlus to write and compile everything.

//Setup

The first program to run is SETUP which will create the data neccessary to run the other programs. 

//Create Order

This is the bulk of the program in which the user will be creating an order.
